<h3><b>Welcome to Exam Development & Testing Services</b></h3>

<h4 style="text-align:right">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp EDTS has been designed and developed by the advanced systems design and implementation classes of the USA graduate IS program.</h4>

<p>
    <h4>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The system is based on beliefs that a curriculum should be built on a body of knowledge which specifies major areas of knowledge.  A &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp skill set is specified based on the body of knowledge to represent capabilities of graduates completing the program.  A sequence of &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp sections containing courses would be completed to assure coverage of desired material.  Proficiency of student at the course level can &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp be assessed by proof of capability at the course outcome level and ultimately by being able to satisfy skill requirements.

<h4>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Faculty and program sufficiency can also be assessed by analyzing aggregate student performances.</h4>
